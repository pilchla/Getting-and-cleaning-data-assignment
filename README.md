# Getting-and-cleaning-data-assignment

In this repository, you will find:

1. A README.md file, which you are reading now.

2. A script ("run_analysis.R") that does the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. A tidy data set ("tidydata.txt") (produced from a [UCI HAR dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones); the zip file can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)), which only contains the mean and standard deviation of each measurement with the corresponding subject IDs and the activities performed.

4. A code book ("codebook.md"), which explains all of the variables that were modified and used as well as other information.
